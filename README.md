This is a change that simeltounesly on experimental branch and commit in both
of them and face to the diverge.

I'm add this line just to experimental branch and after that I will switch to
the Main branch and I expect that this line should't appear at the Main branch.

Create some diference in experimental branch then switch to master branch and 
make changes in master branch then try to commit the master branch so as the 
gittutorial manual page says I will recieve a diverged and error so go until
here.
## Test for 2 commit then push
  1_commit.
  2_commit.

  test for unmassaged commit

  Add a v0.1.1 tag to this commit to show the git log v0.1.0..v0.1.1 changes.

  A little Change to see what's happening in `git diff` and `git diff HEAD`
  and also use the ```git ls-files --stage```

A change that i want to rebase it
